# secure-network-environment
Designed and implemented a secure network environment simulating a real-world attacker–defender scenario. The project integrates an Ubuntu-based firewall (iptables), OpenVPN secure remote access and intrusion detection via packet capture (tcpdump), with attack simulation conducted from Kali Linux and external validation from a Windows host.
