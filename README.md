# Secure Network Environment Project
Designed and implemented a secure network environment simulating a real-world attacker–defender scenario. The project integrates an Ubuntu-based firewall (iptables), OpenVPN secure remote access and intrusion detection via packet capture (tcpdump), with attack simulation conducted from Kali Linux and external validation from a Windows host.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure network environment using firewall rules, VPN services, and intrusion detection techniques.

The environment simulates a real-world attacker–defender scenario using:
- Ubuntu Server (Defender)
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Windows Host (External Tester)

## Technologies Used
- Ubuntu Server
- Kali Linux
- iptables firewall
- OpenVPN
- tcpdump (IDS simulation)
- Nmap
- Bridged Virtual Networking

## Security Features Implemented
- Strict allow-list firewall (iptables)
- OpenVPN secure remote access (UDP 1194)
- Packet capture and intrusion detection using tcpdump
- Attack simulation using ICMP and TCP SYN scans
- External validation from a physical host

## Project Structure
- Report – Full project documentation
- Diagrams – Network architecture diagram
- Screenshots– Firewall, VPN, IDS, and scan evidence
- Configs – Firewall and VPN configuration samples

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Network hardening and access control
- Traffic monitoring and attack detection
- VPN deployment and validation
- Realistic attacker–defender testing methodology
